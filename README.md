# CitiBike_Optimization

The availability of bikes at CitiBike stations is crucial for the reliability and efficiency of New York City’s bike-sharing system. This project estimates the steady-state distribution of available bikes at three selected Manhattan CitiBike stations using Markov chains. The chosen stations — W 21 St & 6 Ave, E 40th St & Park Ave, and West St & Chambers St — reflect diverse commuter behaviors and distinct usage patterns. Using July 2024 weekday ride data, myself, with two Cornell Tech peers, model bike availability at these stations as a Discrete Time Markov Chain with states ranging from empty to fully occupied. Transition probability matrices are estimated from bike arrivals and departures in 5 or 10 minute intervals during morning and evening commuting hours. The report, which is attached in this repository, is structured into modeling methods, findings, and key business implications, highlighting insights into bike-sharing dynamics.
